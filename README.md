# Final Year Project: Idiomatic sentence paraphrasing with supervised machine learning

Machine translation has become ubiquitous in recent years and its quality has been improving quickly. Despite this it still struggles when it comes to non-literal phrases such as idioms. This project explores the idea of applying machine learning to the task of paraphrasing idiomatic sentences into literal ones, a technique that is already used in manual translation for idioms that do not have an equivalent in the target language. To achieve this a pre-trained language model is fine-tuned on a parallel corpus of English sentences containing idioms and their paraphrases that are literal. The resulting paraphrases are then evaluated using automatic metrics.

See `idiom_paraphrasing.ipynb` for details.
